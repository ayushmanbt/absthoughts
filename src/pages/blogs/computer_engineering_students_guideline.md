Well, hello there… This is the time of the season, maybe you are about to start your life as an engineering student this fall or you have already been a student for a year or two. Regardless of where you are in your journey as an engineering student, I have a few milestones set up for you which you can follow one by one which will set you up for getting a job in the final year.

### Step 0: Learn the fundamentals of programming

If you are new to programming, then you should start by picking up a language and understanding the fundamentals of programming with that language. I would highly recommend choosing python as your first language as it is easy to learn and is widely used in many fields. Once you have learnt one language, it is easy to transition from one language to other.

### Step 1: Find your niche

As a computer science student, there are many fields or niches you can choose from. You can be an Android developer, an iOS developer, a web developer, a game developer, a machine learning engineer, a data scientist, and much more. It is crucial to find out your niche, or the field you want to pursue in future.

If you are in your first or second year, this is the ideal time to experiment. I would suggest you try everything and then decide which stream you want to choose. As for my experience, I tried everything starting from game development to web development and even machine learning. Finally, I decided to go with web development.

### Step 2: Make Projects

Now that you have found your niche, you have to learn the ins and outs of the field. And the best way to learn new things is to make projects using that things. For example, if you are learning machine learning, don’t just learn what KNN is. Apply KNN to make a classifier. Making projects is crucial. It will not only help you learn new things, but also it will help you build a portfolio.

### Step 3: Make a Resume

After building a few projects, you can start building a resume. Your resume should be short, highlighting the skills you have. If you are doing android development then don’t put your example machine learning project in your resume. You don’t have to put all your projects in your resume. Having a few relevant and good projects on your resume should be enough.

If you are doing android app development then go an extra step and publish an app in the play store. Make sure this is an app which you will use regularly. Make the code open source. Add this project to your resume. It’s good to have only 2 good projects on your resume rather than 5 bad ones.

### Step 4: Network

It is important to build connections. For this, I recommend using LinkedIn. Just react to people’s posts, connect with people and just approach them. Also, you can network with your college peers and your seniors as well. Building a strong network will help you in the future to get internships and jobs and recommendations. Especially, try to network with people in your niche.

### Step 5: Find an Internship

Congratulations, your hard work has paid off and you have a nice resume with some knowledge in a field. Now it’s time for getting some practical experience. Apply for a few internships. How to find internships? Well, it depends on where you are. In India, there is this popular app called Internshala where you can find decent internships. Also, you can use LinkedIn to find internships as well. This is the right time to utilise your network to find an internship.

### Step 6: Keep learning and update your resume

Well, there is nothing much to say about this step. This step is as it is described in the heading. You just can not stop learning. Learn new things, build new projects and update your resume to be a better and stronger resume.

### Bonus Step: Learn Competitive Programming

This step is not for everyone. This step is especially for people who aspire to work at top-level companies like google or amazon, where they ask tricky data structure and algorithm questions in the interview. Competitive coding helps you to understand the data structures and algorithms. It also helps your problem-solving skills.
